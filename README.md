A simple SUDOKU Solver (WIP)

## Missing Features

- Segment validation to improve possible-checking method
- Backtracking logic
- Cleaning the output (no flag console logging)

## Contributing and Running the Project

- This is a simple Node project, as you'll read below, it's a pet project focused on improving my coding skills; this is the main reason for contributions not being accepted to be merged, but please feel free to open an issue or even adding a PR (won't be merged) to help me learn from your ideas and experience.

## About this project

**SUDOKU Solver** was born as an intent to keep improving my programming skills, mostly around data structures and algorithms. I'm fully aware this is not an original idea and it wont' (most likely) bring new solutions to the table, but it is helpful for me anyways. Also, I love SUDOKUs in general. n_n
